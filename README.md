# smallcapper
A CLI tool that takes a string and smallcaps it.

## Installation
`npm install -g smallcapper`

## Usage
```
> smallcapper 'Some normal text'
Sᴏᴍᴇ ɴᴏʀᴍᴀʟ ᴛᴇxᴛ
```

## Caveats
I wrote this in a few minutes just because I needed the tool to quickly convert text I had in a Google Doc. I have not tested every single edge case and irregulars. I usually pipe it into `pbcopy` so I can paste it right into whatever I need it for. Maybe one day I'll do more text manipulation tools as need arises.

Enjoy!
